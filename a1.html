      <p>Here is all the documentation for assignment 1!
        
          I used one 220Ω resistor for the red light, and two 100Ω resistors for the white and blue lights. 
          For the red light I calculated (5V - 1.8V)/0.02A = 160Ω, 
          and for the white & blue light, I calculated (5V - 3.3V)/0.02A = 85Ω. 
          Rounded, I decided to use one 220Ω resistor, and two 100Ω resistors.

        <code> void setup() {
          // initialize digital pins as an output.
          pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // initialize digital pin 13 (red) as an output.
          pinMode(12, OUTPUT); // initialize digital pin 12 (white) as an output.
          pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // initialize digital pin 11 (blue) as an output.
        
        }
        
        // the loop function runs over and over again forever
        // loop function turns on and off LEDs 
        void loop() {
          digitalWrite(13, HIGH);  // turn the red LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
          delay(1000);             // wait for a second
          digitalWrite(13, LOW);   // turn the red LED off by making the voltage LOW
          delay(1000);             // wait for a second 
          digitalWrite(12, HIGH);  // turn the white LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
          delay(1000);             // wait for a second
          digitalWrite(12, LOW);   // turn the white LED off by making the voltage LOW
          delay(1000);             // wait for a second
          digitalWrite(11, HIGH);  // turn the blue LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)

        <h3>Question 2</h3>
        <p>I could blink 14 LEDS with my Adruino. It would draw a 0.028 A current.</p>

        <h3>Question 4</h3>
        <p>At around 3 seconds, I can't really tell that the lights are blinking.</p>
